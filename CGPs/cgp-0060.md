# Overview

 Status: DRAFT = Feedback collection

As an interim solution to offer cUSD-USDC liquidity before the Giga Mento launch (see [GigaMento Forum Discussion](https://forum.celo.org/t/proposing-a-new-way-to-enable-large-stables-mint-giga-mento/3846)), we suggest to deploy a Constant-Sum Market Maker (CSMM) StableSwap Pool via Mobius, in which protocol-owned liquidity is provided via governance. This allows a similar user experience that GigaMento would offer but requires no new code to be deployed, making it viable as an immediate solution. The differences between a StableSwap pool and GigaMento can be thought of in terms of where the liquidity comes from:

*depending on how the pool is utilized might end up adding liquidity multiple times until we can transition to the GigaMento MVP, see Rebalancing section.
  

## CGP Mechanics

When executed the CGP should:

* Mint cUSD

* Deposit cUSD + USDC (Bridged) to the pool

### Minting cUSD to Governance

Currently only Validators, GrandaMento, and the Mento Exchange contracts are able to mint stable tokens. To get around this we propose temporarily deploying an altered version of the StableToken.sol contract, namely [StableTokenMintableByOwner](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/bowd/cusd-usdc-liquidity-pool/packages/protocol/contracts/stability/StableTokenMintableByOwner.sol). The only difference is that it adds `msg.sender == owner()` as a passing condition in the mint and burn functions, which would allow Governance to mint cUSD.

This new implementation would only be in effect for the duration of the proposal, which means that StableTokenProxy will switch to this new implementation and then switch back, making the CGP look more like this:

### Depositing cUSD and USDC to the pool

In order to deposit the tokens in the pool Governance needs to hold the bridged USDC when the governance proposal is executed, this will be covered more in the Deployment Timing section.

For the addLiquidity function called on the pool to succeed, the pool needs approval to transfer cUSD and USDC from Governance to itself, thus requiring two ERC20 approve calls beforehand, making the process look like this:

For the more technically savvy here’s an [example of transactions](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/bowd/cusd-usdc-liquidity-pool/packages/protocol/test-sol/integration/PremintExample.t.sol#L70-L109) that we simulated on top of a mainnet fork which add 2M cUSD and USDC via a CGP to the existing cUSD-USDC Mobius pool.

## Deployment Timing

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1EyD9em-2iMxMTYh8czTAzRFDwkBVkMSu)

### Phase I - Prepare

This phase consists of:

* Deploy the **StableTokenMintableByOwner** implementation (responsibility of Mento team)

* Deploying the **GnosisSafe multisig** (responsibility of Mento team)

* Deploying the **StableSwap Pool** (responsibility of Mobius team)

* Submitting the **CGP** (responsibility of Mento team)


#### StableTokenMintableByOwner

This contract is a slight modification of the StableToken contract which allows the owner to mint/burn tokens. During the CGP exection, the StableToken proxy will temporarily point to this implementation (see Minting cUSD to Goverance), so we need to deploy it before the CGP is submitted.

#### Multisig

This setup involves three types of tokens:

* cUSD

* USDC (bridged via Portal/Wormhole)

* LP-Tokens from the StableSwap pool.

Our aim is for Governance to hold these tokens for most steps throughout the process, but due to limitations in the setup we will need to deploy a Multisig (GnosisSafe) on Ethereum, managed by a combination of Mento, Foundation and cLabs folks.
  
The Multisig is used to orchestrate the bridging of USDC from the reserve in Phase II via Wormhole. More details on why we need them are discussed in the Phase II - Bridging section.

#### StableSwap Pool
The StableSwap pool ([see contract](https://github.com/mobiusAMM/mobiusV1/blob/master/contracts/Swap.sol)) will be deployed and managed by Mobius, they will use these parameters:

#### Submitting the CGP

This is the most tricky part of this phase as we need to pick values for the variables involved in the process defined above in the CGP Mechanics section. More details on what these variables are and how we need to think about them will be discussed in the CGP Variables section.


### Phase II - Bridge

This phase begins after the CGP is in the Execution phase, which means that we have community buy in and can initiate the more permissioned phase of the process. The desired outcome of this phase is to transfer USDC from the Reserve Custodiam on Ethereum to the Governance contract on Celo, via the Wormhole/Portal bridge.

In an ideal world, this could be done in a fully permissionless manner, the Custodian bridging directly to the Governance contract. But the Custodian only supports simple transfers of funds, not arbitrary transactions therefore we need an intermediate Multisig on Ethereum which will receive a transfer from the Reserve Custodian and bridge the tokens to the Governance contract.

Therefore we recommend this three-step process:

 1. Transfer from USDC from Custodian to GnosisSafe Multisig (ownership TBD)
 2. Deposit USDC in bridge from the GnosisSafe Multisig
 3. Redeem bridged USDC on Celo, which transfers them to Governance (can be called by anyone)
  
The Portal UI has a limitation, you can’t specify the recipient when bridging tokens from Ethereum to Celo, it must be the same address as the sender, but they provide a Javascript SDK that we can use to orchestrate the transfer with more configurability.

### Phase III - Execute

At this point we should have USDC bridged and sitting in the Governance contract, therefore the CGP can now execute the steps outlined above:

* Mint cUSD to itself

* Deposit cUSD and USDC in the Stableswap Pool

Because this is done by the Governance contract the LP tokens and thus custody of the liquidity will remain with Governance.

## CGP Variables

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1r-9iw5W4xwHhXKVvJb-clkA9PED9yPxM)

Because the CGP is submitted prior to the bridging of USDC, we need to ensure that USDC_amount is well defined beforehand and that we understand any fees involved in bridging the assets, so that when we’re ready to execute, Governance owns the exact amount of USDC needed.

The other point of failure is the deadline but setting that to timestamp that’s after the CGP expiration should work fine.

## Rebalancing

The pool will start with 5M each of USDC and cUSD, but depending on the volume of inflows and outflows we might end up unbalanced on either side which will require us to rebalance the pool. There are four possible operations that we need to consider:

* Add/remove cUSD

* Add/remove USDC

### Adding additional cUSD

If the pool gets to be mostly USDC we would want to topup the cUSD bucket. This would require a CGP without the bridging phase which only adds cUSD liquidity to the pool. The mechanics are similar, but we can skip the Bridge phase and we don’t need to approve USDC transfers in the CGP.

### Adding additional USDC

If the pool gets to be mostly cUSD we need to bridge and add additional USDC in the pool. This would require a CGP without the cUSD minting logic.

### Removing cUSD/USDC from the pool

Removing cUSD/USDC from the pool while it’s live can get tricky because we would need to craft the transactions to burn cUSD/transfer USDC from governance before we actually execute the withdrawal, therefore we won’t cover this right now, but rely only on Unwinding which will be done after the pool is paused.

## Unwinding

When we deploy the GigaMento MVP, we will need to unwind this pool. That entails:

* Pausing the pool so no more swaps are possible (Mobius team will have to do it)

* Remove liquidity (cUSD + USDC) from the pool

* Burn cUSD

Transfer USDC to the GigaMento Reserve.sol instance or (back through bridge to the Reserve Custodian)
